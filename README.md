### **Linked-List**  
This folder includes implementations of singly and doubly linked lists. It covers fundamental operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, demonstrating how nodes are connected and manipulated in linear and bidirectional forms.

---

### **Tree**  
Contains experiments on various tree data structures. It includes building and traversing binary search trees (BST), balancing AVL trees using rotations, and implementing heap structures with array-based approaches.

---

### **array**  
Focuses on array manipulation using both static and dynamic memory. It includes basic array operations, matrix arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply), and working with dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`) for more flexible data handling.
